# LFighter: Defending against Label-flipping Attacks in Federated Learning.
This repository contains PyTorch implementation of the paper ''LFighter: Defending against Label-flipping Attacks in Federated Learning''.

## Paper 

[LFighter: Defending against Label-flipping Attacks in Federated Learning]()

## Content
The repository contains one jupyter notebook for each benchmark which can be used to re-produce the experiments reported in the paper for that benchmark. The notebooks contain clear instructions on how to run the experiments. 

## Data sets
[MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) and [CIFAR10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) will be automatically downloaded.
However, [IMDB](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/) requires a manual download using this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CpT7RbswI-pGd4rVfWsgONf7qJQizON0/view?usp=sharing). 
After downloading [IMDB](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/), please save it as imdb.csv in the data folder inside the folder IMDB.


## Dependencies

[Python 3.6](https://www.anaconda.com/download)

[PyTorch 1.6](https://pytorch.org/)

[TensorFlow 2](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
